# Refund Policy

**Last Updated: January 2026**

Thank you for choosing RAW.AI. We strive to provide the best AI humanization service possible. However, we understand that things don't always go according to plan.

## 1. Subscription Refunds

### Monthly & Annual Plans

- **14-Day Money-Back Guarantee**: If you are not satisfied with your subscription, you may request a full refund within 14 days of your initial purchase, provided you have used less than 5% of your monthly/annual credit allocation.
- **After 14 Days**: We do not offer refunds for partial months or unused time for subscriptions cancelled after the 14-day window. Your service will continue until the end of the billing period.

## 2. One-Time Credit Purchases

- **Unused Credits**: Refunds for one-time credit packs can be requested within 7 days of purchase if **no credits from the pack have been used**.
- **Used Credits**: We cannot issue refunds for credit packs that have been partially used.

## 3. How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, please contact our support team at [support@rawai.com](mailto:support@rawai.com) or [arshverma.dev@gmail.com](mailto:arshverma.dev@gmail.com) with the following details:

1.  Your Account Email
2.  Transaction ID / Receipt Number
3.  Reason for the refund request

We will review your request and process approved refunds within 5-7 business days. The funds will be returned to your original payment method.

## 4. Exceptions

- Accounts terminated due to violation of our [Terms of Service](file:///Users/arshverma/GitHub/RAW-AI/src/pages/Terms.tsx) are not eligible for refunds.
- Refunds are not granted for "accidental" usage of the tool (e.g., humanizing the wrong text).
